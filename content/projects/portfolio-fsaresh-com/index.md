# History of this Site
For a long time, I tried to get around building my own website. 

I tried Google Sites, but realized that I didn't like their lack of customization or relying on Google (see my DeGoogle'ing my Life post [^1]).
[^1]: TODO for Farhan: Add that link in there!

I tried a site called Zyro, but it felt too abstract and once again, I didn't have the degree of customization I really wanted in there. Plus, doing things visually instead of using programmatic templates got frustrating after a while. I had to redo the same customizations on every new blog post!

I also tried a few other static site generators like Jekyll, but each one felt like learning a whole new toolset instead of a set-it-up-once thing where I could write Markdown from then on. 

I recently also tried Pynecone/Reflex to build a whole site and discovered I don't enjoy frontend work nearly enough to commit to building a whole website. 

# Intent
Ultimately, I don't want to do anything too fancy here. I want to be able to share resources that have helped me with people -- those resources can be technical, mental health, finance, or anything where I feel like I've had the same discussion many times. I don't mind having those discussions, to be clear, but I'm worried about missing a key detail in my third time repeating information.

My eventual goal here is to be able to set up an Obsidian vault where I can record thoughts (even on the go) and pump out a static site whenever I'm ready to publish! I didn't want to use Obsidian Publish, however, because that both costs more than I want to spend on this and lacks customization (you might be noticing a theme!).

# Next steps
From here, I need to start posting a little more!

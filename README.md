Personal website made via Hugo. I'm aiming to create a space where I can record my thoughts for easier and more centralized sharing. Topics will range from technical things to finance to therapy and mental health resources.

## History of this Site
For a long time, I tried to get around building my own website. 

I tried Google Sites, but realized that I didn't like their lack of customization or relying on Google (see my [DeGoogle'ing my Life post]({{< ref "posts/tech-and-tools/degoogling/index" >}})).

I tried a site called [Zyro](https://www.zyro.com) but it felt too abstract and once again, I didn't have the degree of customization I really wanted in there. Plus, doing things visually instead of using programmatic templates got frustrating after a while. I had to redo the same customizations on every new blog post!

I also tried a few other static site generators like [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), but each one felt like learning a whole new toolset instead of a set-it-up-once thing with proper theming and customization.

I recently also tried Pynecone/Reflex to build a whole site and discovered I don't enjoy frontend work nearly enough to commit to building a whole website. 

## Current Setup
Now, I'm using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/). It's super customizable and the layout and theme structures make more sense to me than Jekyll did.

# Intent
Ultimately, I don't want to do anything too fancy here. I want to be able to share resources that have helped me with people -- those resources can be technical, mental health, finance, or anything where I feel like I've had the same discussion many times. I don't mind having those discussions, to be clear, but I'm worried about missing a key detail in my third time repeating information.

My eventual goal here is to be able to set up an Obsidian vault where I can record thoughts (even on the go) and pump out a static site whenever I'm ready to publish! I didn't want to use Obsidian Publish, however, because that both costs more than I want to spend on this and lacks customization (you might be noticing a theme!).


# Next steps
From here, I need to start posting a little more!
